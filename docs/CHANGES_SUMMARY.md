# Summary of Changes - AWS_WS_FE

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fixed CTA Component Error** ❌ → ✅
- **Problem**: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props
- **Solution**: Converted Button components to native `<button>` elements within the client component
- **File**: `components/landing/CTA.tsx`

### 2. **Fixed F5 Refresh Redirect Issue** 🔄 → ✅
- **Problem**: Users were redirected to login page on F5 refresh
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated middleware to properly check for auth token in cookies
  - Added cookie storage alongside localStorage in authStore
  - Simplified middleware logic to focus on token existence rather than role validation
- **Files**: 
  - `middleware.ts` - Simplified authentication check
  - `store/authStore.ts` - Added cookie helper functions and cookie storage

### 3. **Removed Alert Notifications** 🔔 → ✅
- **Problem**: Alert popups appearing on login/register
- **Solution**: Replaced with inline error messages using beautiful error cards
- **Files**: 
  - `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Added inline error display with AlertCircle icon
  - `app/auth/register/page.tsx` - Added inline error display with AlertCircle icon

### 4. **Updated Navigation for CLIENT_USER** 👤 → ✅
- **Problem**: CLIENT_USER saw "Dashboard" instead of "Profile"
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated Header component to show "Profile" for CLIENT_USER
  - Updated login/register redirects: CLIENT_USER → homepage, others → dashboard
  - Updated CTA button text based on role
- **Files**:
  - `components/layout/Header.tsx` - Already had proper logic
  - `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - CLIENT_USER redirects to `/`
  - `app/auth/register/page.tsx` - CLIENT_USER redirects to `/`
  - `components/landing/CTA.tsx` - Different button text for CLIENT_USER

### 5. **Added Nearby Search Feature** 📍 → ✅
- **Implementation**:
  - Created new NearbySearch component with geolocation support
  - Integrated with backend API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/search/nearby`
  - Added geocoding support using OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
  - Integrated into SearchFilters component with toggle button
- **Files**:
  - `components/search/NearbySearch.tsx` - New component
  - `lib/api.ts` - Added `nearby` search API method
  - `components/landing/SearchFilters.tsx` - Integrated NearbySearch component

## 🎯 Features Added

### Nearby Search Component Features:
1. **Get Current Location**: Uses browser's geolocation API
2. **Search by Address**: Geocodes address using OpenStreetMap
3. **Configurable Radius**: User can set search radius (1-100 km)
4. **Type Filter**: Filter by "gym" or "pt" or show all
5. **Beautiful Results Display**: Shows results with distance, rating, and address
6. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for location/geocoding failures

### API Integration:
```javascript
// Nearby Search API
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/search/nearby
Query Parameters:
- lat (required): Latitude
- lon (required): Longitude
- radius (required): Search radius in km
- type (optional): "gym" or "pt"
- page, size: Pagination
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Login Flow:
1. User enters credentials
2. Token saved to both localStorage AND cookies
3. Redirect based on role:
   - `CLIENT_USER` → Homepage (`/`)
   - `ADMIN` → `/dashboard/admin`
   - `GYM_STAFF` → `/dashboard/gym-staff`
   - `PT_USER` → `/dashboard/pt`

### Register Flow:
Same as login flow

### Session Persistence:
- Token stored in localStorage (for API calls)
- Token stored in cookies (for middleware validation)
- F5 refresh now maintains authentication state

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Error Display:
- Beautiful inline error cards with AlertCircle icon
- Red gradient background with border
- Auto-clears when user starts typing
- No more intrusive alerts

### Navigation:
- CLIENT_USER sees "Profile" instead of "Dashboard"
- Other roles see "Dashboard"
- Proper role-based routing throughout the app

## 📁 Files Modified

1. `components/landing/CTA.tsx` - Fixed button event handlers
2. `middleware.ts` - Simplified auth check with cookie support
3. `store/authStore.ts` - Added cookie storage helpers
4. `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Inline errors + role-based redirect
5. `app/auth/register/page.tsx` - Inline errors + role-based redirect
6. `lib/api.ts` - Added nearby search API
7. `components/landing/SearchFilters.tsx` - Integrated nearby search
8. `components/search/NearbySearch.tsx` - NEW FILE

## 🚀 How to Use Nearby Search

### For Users:
1. Go to homepage
2. Click "Show Nearby Search" button
3. Either:
   - Click "Use My Current Location" (requires browser permission)
   - Enter an address and click search icon
4. Adjust radius and type filters as needed
5. View results with distance and ratings

### For Frontend Development:
```typescript
import { api } from '@/lib/api';

// Search nearby gyms/trainers
const response = await api.search.nearby({
  lat: 21.029,
  lon: 105.853,
  radius: 10, // km
  type: 'gym', // optional: 'gym' | 'pt'
  page: 0,
  size: 20
});

// Results format:
// {
//   results: [
//     {
//       id: 1,
//       name: "EasyBody Gym",
//       location: { latitude, longitude, address },
//       distance: 0.52, // km
//       type: "gym",
//       averageRating: 4.5
//     }
//   ],
//   pagination: { page, size, total }
// }
```
